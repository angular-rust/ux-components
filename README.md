**UX Components** is a free, open source, cross-platform widget toolkit for building a GUI for Rust. This project is inspired by Mx GUI Library, Clutter Project, Meego and Moblin. 

**Angular Rust** is a high productivity, `platform-agnostic` frontend framework for the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It now supports desktop and web development. Angular Rust currently uses OpenGL ES 2.0+ for desktop development and WebAssembly for web development. We are planning to add support for mobile development.

## Quick Start

Install UX Components:

	cargo add ux-components
